Long-Term X-Ray/UV Variability in ULXs
======================================

This repository contains the various scripts used for downloading of raw data,
pipeline reduction, and analysis for both the XRT and UVOT aboard the The Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/ for around ~40
Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). 

This code was written without the expectation of anyone other than myself using it
and as such is not fully documented and may contain bugs. There are also scripts that
are half-finished or experimental.

The main reduction scripts are to be called in numerical order and anyone with
familiarity with heasoft should be able to quickly modify them for their own
needs.

This code does not contain methods for the centroiding sources in the UVOT,
this is as the XRT coordinates were used for the UVOT reduction.

The model/area.py file contains a model for the calculation of the area observed
at arbitrary inclination for a star irradiated by a conical beam of emission.








Long-Term X-Ray/UV Variability in ULXs
======================================

This repository contains various scripts for downloading raw data, pipeline
reduction, and analysis of the XRT and UVOT instruments aboard the Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory (https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/) for approximately 40
Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs).

Please note that this code was originally developed for personal use and may
not be fully documented or free of bugs. Some scripts may be incomplete or
experimental.  Getting Started

The main reduction scripts should be executed in numerical order. Users
familiar with HEASoft should be able to easily modify them for their own needs.
Limitations

This code does not include methods for centroiding sources in the UVOT.
Instead, the XRT coordinates were used for UVOT reduction.  Features

The model/area.py file contains a model for calculating the observed area at an
arbitrary inclination for a star irradiated by a conical beam of emission.
