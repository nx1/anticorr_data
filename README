Long-Term X-Ray/UV Variability in ULXs
======================================

This repository contains various scripts for downloading raw data, pipeline
reduction, and analysis of the XRT and UVOT instruments aboard the Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory (https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/) for approximately 40
Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs).

Please note that this code was originally developed for personal use and may
not be fully documented or free of bugs. Some scripts may be incomplete or
experimental.  Getting Started

The main reduction scripts should be executed in numerical order. Users
familiar with HEASoft should be able to easily modify them for their own needs.
Limitations

This code does not include methods for centroiding sources in the UVOT.
Instead, the XRT coordinates were used for UVOT reduction.  Features

The model/area.py file contains a model for calculating the observed area at an
arbitrary inclination for a star irradiated by a conical beam of emission.
